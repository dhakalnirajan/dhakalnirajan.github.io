                                it's
                                a symphony for food enthusiasts. An opportunity

                                first year in college and we decided to go for
                                designing such a system as a project because it
                                is designed in the curriculum. It was designed
                                when we were still learning Web Technologies and
                                we were able to learn a lot from it due to all
                                the struggles we went through in designing such

                                Teaching is not just my passion; it's a journey
                                of transformation and enlightenment. In the
                                captivating realm of Machine Learning, Python,
                                Astronomy, and C programming, I've worn the hat
                                of an educator and conductor, orchestrating
                                countless symphonies of learning.

                                various capacities. One memorable chapter was my
                                role as an instructor in a Python workshop,
                                hosted by a dynamic student organization where I
                                am actively involved. The workshop was a gateway
                                for aspiring programmers, a place where the
                                language of Python unfolded its beauty.

                                But my journey didn't stop there. The following

                                Machine Learning. The wheels of learning were
                                set in motion as I took the stage as an
                                instructor in the Machine Learning Bootcamp
                                organized by the same student organization. It
                                was a week of exploration, discovery, and diving
                                into the depths of artificial intelligence.
